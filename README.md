# Boston Crime Incidence Prediction

Boston’s crime index rating of 18 suggests that it is safer than only 18% of the cities in United States. The number is startling considering that 89.66% of Boston’s workforce is employed in white-collar jobs, which is well above the national average. Considering the nature of crime in Boston, several studies have been conducted to compare the city’s demographics with its crime rate.

This project analyzes the incidence of crime in Boston from 2015 - 2018 to understand the dependence of crime upon location, time and demographic attributes. It aims to explain the significance of underlying factors in determining and predicting the crime rates within various regions of Boston and designing prevention strategies accordingly.
